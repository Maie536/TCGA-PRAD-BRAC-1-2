# Meta Information for Altered and Unaltered Sample Files

## General Description

These files contain lists of Sample IDs from a virtual study conducted via the cBioPortal platform. The study focuses on patients with prostate cancer, specifically looking into alterations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Each file represents a distinct group based on the mutation status of these genes in their samples.

- **`altered_samples.txt`**: This file lists patients whose samples show alterations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.
- **`unaltered_samples.txt`**: This file lists patients with no alterations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.

## File Structure

Each file is structured as a plain text file, where each line represents a unique Sample ID from the study. There are no headers or additional metadata within these files.

Example line from `altered_samples.txt` or `unaltered_samples.txt`:

```
prad_tcga_pub: SAMPLE_ID_123
```

## Source

These files are derived from the following virtual study on the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics:

- **Study Name**: Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA, Cell 2015)
- **cBioPortal Study ID**: `prad_tcga_pub`
- **cBioPortal URL**: [https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=prad_tcga_pub](https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=prad_tcga_pub)

## Intended Use

These files are intended for research purposes, to facilitate the analysis of genetic alterations in prostate cancer patients and their potential impact on prognosis, treatment outcomes, or any other clinical correlation. Researchers might use these files to segregate patient data based on BRCA1/BRCA2 alteration status before conducting further genetic, molecular, or clinical analyses.
